* Encryption of messages  
* Message is encoded by shifting it's letters a specific numbeer of position either to the right or left.
* Receiver of the message is the only one told about the No. of shifts used in encryption in order to decode the hidden message.
* The program takes a message, then does a shift as specified by the author during encoding process.
  
* Happy coding!!
